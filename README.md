# 🧠 Crypto Journey – Learning Cryptography with Python

Welcome to my personal journey into the world of cryptography.

This repository is a growing collection of classic cryptographic algorithms implemented in Python, created as part of my long-term goal to become a Post-Quantum Security Engineer. I'm starting from the ground up, learning both the theoretical foundations and how they translate into code.

Every file or folder here represents a milestone in this journey — from basic substitution ciphers like Caesar and Vigenère, to bitwise operations like XOR, and eventually into modern cryptography and quantum-resistant algorithms.

## 🔍 What you'll find here:

- 🏛️ **Classic Ciphers**: Educational Python implementations of historical ciphers (Caesar, XOR, Vigenère, etc.)
- 🧪 **Experimentation**: Scripts that experiment with encryption, decryption, and how various ciphers behave
- 📚 **Learning Notes**: Simple explanations in README files to help others follow along
- 💡 **Personal Growth**: A way for me to track progress as I move from basic crypto to post-quantum security

## 📌 Why this project?

In a world increasingly shaped by digital security, understanding how encryption works is no longer optional — especially for those who want to work in cybersecurity or cryptographic engineering.

This repository helps me:
- Solidify concepts through code
- Build a clean, visible learning portfolio
- Stay accountable and consistent
- Eventually apply this knowledge in real-world systems and post-quantum security work

## 🚧 What's next?

I'm continuously adding:
- New cipher implementations
- Better command-line interfaces
- Real-world use cases (ex: encrypting files, using Python libraries like `cryptography` or `PyCryptodome`)
- Basic CTF-like exercises to apply what I’ve learned
